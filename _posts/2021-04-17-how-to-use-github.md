# How to Use GitHub

GitHub is an amazing open source platform. It's so amazing, in fact, that this blog was made on it! *[See SpeedoThreeSixty's blog.](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/blog/)*

## Creating a Repository

To create a repository, visit <https://github.com/new>. Pick your own profile for a personal repository, or an organization for a team-based repository. Make sure to include a good description of your new repository, and to enable the initial commits provided.

## What Do the Tabs Do?

### Code

This is your code for the repository. It could be information about your project, npm package code, config files, etc. This is where everything you need to get done lives.

### Issues

This is for users (including yourself and admins!) to report bugs, problems, and, if Discussions is not enabled, questions, ideas, protests, etc. This is where most pull requests are born - For fixing bug reports!

### Pull requests

This is where code that hasn't made it into complete production lives. They mostly resolve issues!

### Actions

Your repository can live on its own with these big boys!

### Projects

Editing code directly and looking at jumbles of issues, pull requests, discussions, et. al. things included in GitHub is terrible. When you create a project, however, it manages itself and organizes your work - Even for other teams to collaborate on in real time!

### Wiki

This is for a "mini-Fandom" about your repository. **By default, only repository collaborators can edit it,** but you can change that setting to allow anyone to edit the "mini-Fandom"!

### Security

If a security leak, hack exploit, or antimalicious services go down, this can help with reporting these correctly and warning others about existing security threats!

### Settings

GitHub by default is dumb. Let's change it!
